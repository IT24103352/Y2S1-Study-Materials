## Part 1: Linear Regression

### 1. How do you load the Boston.CSV dataset using pandas and display its first five rows?

---

### 2. How do you separate the dataset into independent variables (x) and the target variable (y)?

---

### 3. How would you split the dataset into training and testing sets using an 80-20 split?

---

### 4. How do you create a linear regression model object and train it on the training dataset?

---

### 5. How do you retrieve the coefficients and intercept of the trained linear regression model?

---

### 6. How would you evaluate the model's performance on the training data using the R-squared metric?

---

### 7. How can you calculate the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for the test dataset?

---

### 8. How can you predict the value of the target variable for a new custom input row?

---

## Part 2: Logistic Regression

### 9. How do you load the diabetes.CSV dataset and display its first few rows?

---

### 10. How would you separate the dataset into feature variables (x) and the target variable (y)?

---

### 11. How do you split the dataset into training and testing sets using an 80-20 ratio?

---

### 12. How do you create a logistic regression model object and train it on the training data?

---

### 13. How do you extract the learned coefficients and intercept from the trained logistic regression model?

---

### 14. How can you use the trained model to predict class labels for the test dataset?

---

### 15. How can you predict class probabilities for each observation in the test set?

---

### 16. How do you generate a confusion matrix to evaluate model performance?

---

### 17. How do you visualize the confusion matrix using a heatmap?

---

### 18. How do you calculate the accuracy and misclassification error of the logistic regression model?

---

### 19. How do you generate a classification report including precision, recall, and F1-score?
