## Questions

### Question 1
Consider the following functional dependencies for a relation R: (A, B, C, D, E, F)

F = {AC→D, CD→B, D→E, E→F}

(a) Find all keys of R.

---

### Question 2
Consider the following functional dependencies for a relation: R (A, B, C, D, E, F)

F = {AB→C, DC→AE, E→F}

(a) Find all the keys of R.

---

### Question 3
Consider a relation R = (A, B, C, D) with the following functional dependencies:

F = {CE→D, D→B, C→A}

(a) Find all candidate keys in R

(b) Which normal form is R in?

(c) If the relation is not in BCNF, convert it to a set of relations in BCNF through decomposition.

---

### Question 4
Consider a relation R (A, B, C, D, E), with the following set of functional dependencies over R:

F = {A→BC, BC→E, E→DA}

(a) Find all the keys in R.

(b) Is R in BCNF? If R is not in BCNF, convert it to a set of BCNF relations.

---

### Question 5
Consider the following functional dependencies for a relation R(A, B, C, D, E)

F = {AB→C, AB→D, D→A, BC→D, BC→E}

(a) Find all the keys of R.

(b) Is R in BCNF? Give reasons for your conclusion. If R is not in BCNF, convert it to a set of BCNF relations.

---

### Question 6
Consider a relation R = (A, B, C, D, E) with the following functional dependencies:

F = {BC→ADE, D→B}

(a) Find all candidate keys in R

(b) Which normal form is R in?

(c) If the relation is not in BCNF, convert it to a set of relations in BCNF through decomposition
