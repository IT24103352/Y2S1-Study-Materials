## Questions

### Question 1

Find Q1, Q2, and Q3 for the following data set, and draw a box-and-whisker plot.

{2, 6, 7, 8, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 22, 23}

Also determine whether there any outliers.

---

### Question 2

Draw a box-and-whisker plots for the two data sets

{3, 7, 8, 5, 12, 14, 21, 13, 18} & {3, 7, 8, 5, 12, 14, 21, 15, 18, 14}

---

### Question 3

Suppose that the box-and-whisker plots below represent quiz scores out of 25 points for Quiz 1 and Quiz 2 for the same class.

```
Test 2  ├───┬═══╪═══┬───┤
Test 1  ├─────┬═══╪═══┬───┤
        └─┴─┴─┴─┴─┴─┴─┴─┴─┴─┴─┴─┴─
        0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24
```

What do these box-and-whisker plots show about how the class did on Test 2 compared to Test 1?

Also check whether there are any outliers in the two tests.

### Question 4

The following dollar amounts were the hourly collections from a Salvation Army kettle at a local store one day in December:

$19, $26, $25, $37, $32, $28, $22, $23, $29, $34, $39, $31

Construct the box-and-whisker plot for the amount collected. Also find whether there are any outliers.

---

### Question 5

Construct the box-and-whisker plot and find the outliers, if any, for the following data set.

10.2, 14.1, 14.4, 14.4, 14.4, 14.5, 14.5, 14.6, 14.7, 14.7, 14.7, 14.9, 15.1, 15.9, 16.4

---

### Question 6

Find the outliers, if any, for the following data set, and draw box-and-whisker plot. Mark any outliers with an asterisk.

21, 23, 24, 25, 29, 33, 49

---

### Question 7

Draw the box-and-whisker plot for the following data set.

77, 79, 80, 86, 87, 87, 94, 99

---

### Question 8

Determine the mean, median and mode values for the data set:

{3, 8, 10, 7, 5, 14, 2, 9, 8}

---

### Question 9

Determine the mean, median and mode values for the data set:

{26, 31, 21, 29, 32, 26, 25, 28}

---

### Question 10

Determine the mean, median and mode values for the data set:

{4.72, 4.71, 4.74, 4.73, 4.72, 4.71, 4.73, 4.72}

---

### Question 11

21 bricks have a mean mass of 24.2kg and 29 similar bricks have a mean mass of 23.6kg. Determine the mean mass of the 50 bricks.

---

### Question 12

Determine the standard deviation from the mean of the following set of numbers correct to 3 significant figures. Calculate coefficient of variation.

{35, 22, 25, 23, 28, 33, 30}

---

### Question 13

The values of capacitances, in microfarads, of ten capacitors selected at random from a large batch of similar capacitors are: 34.3, 25.0, 30.4, 34.6, 29.6, 28.7, 33.4, 32.7, 29.0 and 31.3. Determine the standard deviation from the mean for these capacitors, correct to 3 significant figures. Calculate coefficient of variation.

---

### Question 14

Determine the standard deviation from the mean, correct to 4 significant figures, for the heights of the 100 people given in the following frequency table.

| Height | Frequency |
|:---|:---|
| 153 | 5 |
| 160 | 18 |
| 167 | 20 |
| 174 | 27 |
| 181 | 22 |
| 188 | 8 |
