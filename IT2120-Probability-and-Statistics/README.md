## Module Description

### Aim

The aim of this module is to introduce the student with the probability concepts and different probability distributions to interpret, analyze, predict, and generalize data as well as time series and queue models. The students will learn the basics of statistics, different probability distributions, inferential statistics, regression analysis, time series, and queueing theory.

---

## Learning Outcomes

At the end of the module, the student will be able to:

**LO1:** Demonstrate the concepts of statistics and calculate probabilities from different probability distributions

**LO2:** Predict population parameters and test hypothesis

**LO3:** Derive regression models and apply them to solve IT-related complex problems

**LO4:** Analyse and predict using time series data

**LO5:** Predict and optimize the queues in various IT applications
