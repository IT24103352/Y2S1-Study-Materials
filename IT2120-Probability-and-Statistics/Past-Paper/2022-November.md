## Question 01
**25 Marks**

a) In an experiment, it is given that $P(A)=0.53$, $P(B)=0.31$ and $P(A\cup B)=0.6757.$
    i. Are A and B mutually exclusive? Give the proof.
    (3 marks)
    ii. Are A and B independent? Give the proof.
    (3 marks)

b) The loaves of bread distributed to local stores in Western province of Sri Lanka by a certain bakery have an average length of 28cm and a standard deviation of 2.5cm. Assuming that the lengths are normally distributed,
    i. What percentage of the loaves of breads are in between 27.3cm and 31.8cm in length?
    (6 marks)
    ii. At which length of breads, 30% of breads are lengthier than this length?
    (6 marks)
    iii. A researcher has drawn a random sample of 35 breads. What is the probability that mean length of breads is less than 27cm?
    (7 marks)

## Question 02
**25 Marks**

a) In a random sample of five measurements, the mean diameter of a sphere was recorded by a scientist as 6.34cm with a standard deviation of 0.021cm. Construct 95% confidence interval for true mean diameter of the sphere and interpret (Round up the answer up to 2 decimal places).
(10 marks)

b) In one of popular American journals, researchers reported that individuals who practice Transcendental Meditation (TM) lower their blood pressure significantly. After the mediation, if a random sample of 300 female TM practitioners shows a mean blood pressure of 115 mm Hg with a standard deviation of 3 mm Hg, does it suggests that, on average, females who practice TM meditate lower their blood pressure than 120 mm Hg? Test at 5% level of significance. (Round up the test statistic up to 2 decimal places)
(15 marks)

## Question 03
**25 Marks**

a) In an experiment with peas, it was observed that 310 were round and yellow, 107 were round and green, 105 were wrinkled and yellow, and 37 were wrinkled and green. According to the theory of heredity, the probability distribution of peas should be as follows.
Is there any evidence to doubt the theory at 0.05 level of significance? (Round up the test statistic up to 4 decimal places)

| Peas Type | Round and Yellow | Round and Green | Wrinkled and Yellow | Wrinkled and Green |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Count** | 310 | 107 | 105 | 37 |
| **Probability** | $7/16$ | $3/16$ | $5/16$ | $1/16$ |

(25 marks)

## Question 04
**25 Marks**

The thrust of an engine (v) in newton is a function of exhaust temperature (x) in ${}^{0}F$ when other important variables are held constant. To determine the relationship between thrust of an engine and temperature data was collected at nine different temperatures. Figure below displays the scatter plot for the data (Give all of your answers in four decimal places).

### Probability and Statistics (IT2110)
### Equation Sheet

* Transformation of Normal random variable (X) into Standard normal random variable (Z):
    $Z=\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}$

* Chi Squared Test Statistic:
    $X^{2}=\sum_{all~i}\frac{(O_{i}-E_{i})^{2}}{E_{i}}$

* Pearson's Product Moment Correlation Coefficient:
    $r=\frac{n(\Sigma xy)-(\Sigma x)(\Sigma y)}{\sqrt{(n(\Sigma x^{2})-(\Sigma x)^{2})*(n(\Sigma y^{2})-(\Sigma y)^{2})}}$
