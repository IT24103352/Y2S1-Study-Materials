## Question 02
**25 Marks**

a) A random sample of 12 undergraduates of a certain university in Sri Lanka typed an average of 68.4 words per minute with a standard deviation of 7.3 words per minute. Construct a 95% confidence interval for the true average number of words typed by all undergraduates of this university and interpret.
(Round up the answer to the nearest integer).
(10 marks)

b) A researcher claimed that average content of containers of a particular lubricant is 10 liters. He selected a random sample of 35 containers and found that average content of this sample containers is 10.56 liters with a standard deviation of 1.246 liters. Assuming that contents of containers are normally distributed test the researcher's claim at 5% level of significance and give your conclusions (Round up the test statistic up to 2 decimal places).
(15 marks)

## Question 03
**25 Marks**

a) A survey was conducted in two major cities in a country to determine voter sentiment about three political candidates in an upcoming election. Thousand voters were randomly selected from the two cities and following data were recorded. Test whether voter sentiment is independent from the city. Consider 5% level of significance (Round up the test statistic up to 4 decimal places).
(25 marks)

| City | Favour A | Favour B | Favour C | Total |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| City 1 | 210 | 221 | 95 | 526 |
| City 2 | 211 | 176 | 87 | 474 |
| Total | 421 | 397 | 182 | 1000 |

## Question 04
**25 Marks**

A study was conducted by a team of researchers to determine if certain static arm-strength measures are related with "dynamic lift" characteristics of an individual. Twenty-five individuals were subjected to strength tests and were asked to perform a weight lifting test in which weight was dynamically lifted overhead. Figure below displays the scatter plot for the data (Give all of your answers in four decimal places).

**Scatter Plot for Dynamic Lift Vs Arm Strength**

[Image of: a scatter plot showing a positive correlation between Arm Strength (x-axis, 20-50) and Dynamic Lift (y-axis, 60-100)]

R outputs of the regression model are shown below.

**Regression Model**

| Coefficient | Value |
|---|---|
| Intercept | 45.805 |
| Arm Strength | 1.107 |

**Analysis of Variance Table**
Response: Dynamic\_Lift

| | Df | Sum Sq | Mean Sq | F value | Pr(>F) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Arm\_Strength | A | 2863.20 | F | G | 7.532e-09 |
| Residuals | B | D | 36.7 | | |
| Total | C | E | | | |

a) What can be concluded using the scatterplot? (2 marks)
b) Find values marked A, B, C, D, E, F and G in the ANOVA table (Show your work). (10 marks)
c) State the estimated regression equation in the form of $\hat{Y} = \hat{\alpha} + \hat{\beta}X$ and interpret. (4 marks)
d) Calculate Pearson's correlation coefficient between arm strength and dynamic lift. (4 marks)
e) Test whether population correlation ($\rho$) between arm strength and dynamic lift is significant at 5% level of significance. (5 marks)

## Probability and Statistics (IT2110)
### Equation Sheet

**Transformation of Normal random variable (X) into Standard normal random variable (Z):**
$$Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}$$

**Chi Squared Test Statistic:**
$$X^2 = \sum_{i} \sum_{j} \frac{(O_{ij} - E_{ij})^2}{E_{ij}}$$

**Pearson's Product Moment Correlation Coefficient:**
$$r = \frac{n(\sum xy) - (\sum x)(\sum y)}{\sqrt{[n(\sum x^2) - (\sum x)^2][n(\sum y^2) - (\sum y)^2]}}$$
