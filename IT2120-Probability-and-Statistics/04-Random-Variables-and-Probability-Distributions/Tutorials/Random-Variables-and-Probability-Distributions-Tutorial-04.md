## Questions

### Question 1

The discrete random variable X has probability function given by P(X = x) = cx² where, X = 1, 2, 3, 4. Find c and E(X).

| X | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| P(X = x) | c | 4c | 9c | 16c |

### Question 2

The random variable X has a binomial distribution with parameters n = 100 and p = 0.8. Find the mean and the variance of X.

---

### Question 3

A manufacturing process produces components which are free from any faults with probability p. Find the probability that in a sample of size 50 from a large batch there are fewer than 4 faulty components when p = 0.95. Find the probability that in a sample of size 50 there are fewer than 10 faulty when p = 0.75.

### Question 4

Use the table to give a suitable approximation to the probability that X ≥ 5 where X is binomial random variable with parameters p = 0.05 and n = 400.

---

### Question 5

A car-pooling study shows that the number of passengers, X in a car (excluding the driver) is likely to assume the values 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 with probabilities given by the table.

| X | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| P(X = x) | 0.7 | 0.1 | 0.1 | 0.05 | 0.05 |

(c) Calculate,

i. E(X)

ii. E(X²)

iii. V(X)

iv. E(3X - 2)

v. Var(2X + 6)

### Question 7

A multiple-choice test has four possible answers to each of 16 questions. A student guesses the answer to each question, i.e., the probability of getting a correct answer on any given question is 0.25. What is the probability that at least 14 questions be correct?

### Question 9

A small life insurance company has determined that on the average it receives 6 death claims per day. Find the probability that the company receives at least seven death claims on a randomly selected day.

---

### Question 10

The number of traffic accidents that occur on a particular stretch of road during a month follows a Poisson distribution with a mean of 9.4. Find the probability that less than two accidents will occur on this stretch of road during a randomly selected month.

---

### Question 11

Suppose that in late summer, the Fremantle Surf Life Saving club makes an average of two surf rescues per day. Use the Poisson probability distribution to determine the probability that

(a) More than two rescues are made on a particular day.

(b) Five surf rescues are made in a 3-day period.

---

### Question 12

An inventory study determines that, on average, demands for a particular item at a warehouse are made 5 times per day. What is the probability that on a given day this item is requested,

(a) More than 5 times?

(b) Not at all?
